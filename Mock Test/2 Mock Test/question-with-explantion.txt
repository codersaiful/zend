Q: Which of the following statements best describes the @ operator when used in PHP code?

Ans: The @ operator in PHP is used to suppress error messages generated by the expression it precedes. This can be useful to avoid cluttering the output with unwanted error messages, however it's important to note that the error messages are still generated, they are just not displayed. Additionally, the error messages are not logged anywhere and it's recommended to not use the @ operator too often, as it can make debugging more difficult.

Q: Which of the statements below best describe the following PHP code.
$output = `ls`;
Ans: The code above uses the backtick operator (``) to execute the shell command "ls" and store the output in the variable $output. The backtick operator in PHP is used to execute shell commands and capture their output. The output of the command will be stored as a string in the $output variable.

It's important to note that the backtick operator is only available in UNIX-based systems and not in Windows. In Windows, the similar "exec()" function can be used instead. Additionally, it's recommended to be careful when using the backtick operator and shell commands in general, as it can potentially be a security risk.
